SCSS Partials
  - Formalitites
  - Truth be Told
  - No one cares
  - SCSS Partials
    - Goals of the Talk
      - A "better" way to organize
      - Figure out...
    - "Where the Fuck is my style"
    - Wayback:
      - CSS was king
      - SCSS was coming on the scene
        - Still using CSS principles
    - One File to Rule them all
      - 4500+ lines of styles 
      - But look, it is nested.
    - Intro to Partials
      - Small manageable files for SCSS
      - Goal is to brak down the design into components
      - But How should we break it down
    - Wild West
      - Partial organization is based on:
        - Designers
        - Developers
          - Frontend
          - Backend
          - Site Builders
      - "Someone go back to town and get me a shit load of dimes"
    - Pinpointing the Pain
      - Communication
      - Partial Organzation != CSS Organization approach
      - The project you are working on, is not yours.
        - Unless it is actually yours. 
    - Mitigating the Pain
      - Community Proposed Systems
        - SMACSS
        - OOCSS
        - BEM
        - OSTSCSS
          - Oh Shit, Time to SCSS
    - Brief overview
    - SMACSS
      - modular styles
      - class based
      - semantic classes 
    - SMACSS example
      - .slide 
      - .slide--title
      - .slide--content
      - .slide--content--title
      - .slide--content--content
    - OOCSS
      - Object Oriented Styling
      - Base classes that can be extended. 
        - (All CSS is therefore OOCSS)
    - OOCSS example  
      - .box { styles }
      - .media { styles }
      - .leftCol { styles } //Yes, this is one of their examples
    - BEM
      - Block. Element. Modifier
      - Communication is Key
      - Blocks can be placed anywhere on the page
      - Styles should always be relevant
      - Modify where necessary
      - Most Drupal-y
    - BEM Example
      - Images from github repo
    - OSTSCSS
      - Last Minute
      - Never Organized.
      - QA Bastardizations
      - Never Maintainable
      - All dreams went here, and died. 
    - OSTSCSS example
      - .node-type-blog .field-type-image.field-name-reallypretty-imgae .field-content > img:first-child{}
    - OSTSCSS issues
      - .node-type-blog .field-type-image.field-name-reallypretty-imgae .field-content > img:first-child{}
      - It is SCSS but no nesting, just appended
      - Really lengthy
      - And really? > with a :first-child? 
    - Issues with Every other system
      - Technical Debt 
      - Communication
      - Drupal is not yours to do what you want
    - Tangential Confession... 
    - I don't mind Drupal's Markup...
    - Why?
      - It is consistent
      - It isn't me
      - It is fairly logical
        - I understand why it was written that way
    - What I don't like?
      - It is bloated
      - Some seems completely unnecessary
      - But does it matter?
    - Yes
    - No
    - Matters
      - True: It should be more semantic
      - False: loadtime is not suffering, that much 
      - True: It can lead to bad practices
      - False: Cleaning it up, isn't always better.
    - What does this have to do with Partials?
    - Exactly!
    - SMACSS in drupal
      - shit
    - OOCSS in drupal
      - closer
      - still shit
    - BEM in drupal
      - a lot closer
      - potential for sharknado disaster
    - OSTSCSS 
      - Nowhere even close
    - All of them 
      - Howdahell
        - template override
        - theme overrides
        - hook_alter_ah_not_again()
        - Rewrite all the views
    - All of them
      - require technical debt 
      - maintenance nightmares
    - How do we proceed?
    - Let's talk
    - Your project 
      - Is the dictator
      - Until it is dead.
      - Completely dead.
      - Like Zombies have agreed it is dead
    - You are 
      - the loyal companion
      - whisper directions
      - communicate
      - You are not your project. 
      - You are not the dictator. #sorrynotsorry
    - What about the partials?
    - Exactly!
    - Truth
      - I can't tell you
    - Proposal:
      - SCSS Skeleton
    - Folder Structure Overview
      - base
      - styleguide
      - layout
      - design 
    - base
      - _libraries.scss
      - _variables.scss
      - _mixins.scss
      - _extends.scss
      - _functions.scss
    - styleguide
      - _icons.scss
      - _text.scss
      - _ui.scss
      - _etc....
      - Based off of the styleguide module
        - Use it
    - layout
      - _layout.scss
      - Holds the layout of the site and different layouts
      - After initial setup, almost never touched.
      - No! Your skin doesn't belong here, Dohmer.
    - design
      - _design.scss
      - The rest...
    - The Rest is complicated, right now
    - My proposal
      - Structure your partials how your site is structured
    - design example
      - components
      - regions
        - _regions.scss
        - _sidebar_second.scss
        - _sidebar_first.scss
        - _l_content.scss
      - system
        - _system.scss
        - _main_menu.scss
      - fields
      - nodes 
      - views
      - blocks
    - components
      - reusable styles and components of the site
      - Ex: _tile-teaser 
        - written %tile-teaser { styles }
        - .tile-teaser { @extend %tile-teaser; }
    - Questions?
      - What if the structure of my site changes?
      - Is this maintainable?
      - How does this translate to devs brought on the project?
      - What if we change the backend?
      - Why?
